## Cons

1. **Plot**: The film has a clichÃ©d and predictable plot that has been seen in many Bollywood movies before. The film is a remake of the novel Love Story by Eric Segal, which was also adapted into a Hollywood movie in 1970. The film follows the same formula of a rich boy falling in love with a poor girl, facing opposition from their families, and dealing with a terminal illness. The film does not offer anything new or original in terms of story or execution.
2. **Melodrama**: The film has a lot of melodrama and exaggeration that may seem unrealistic and over-the-top. The film has many scenes that are too dramatic or cheesy, such as the hero breaking into a library to confess his love, the heroine getting disowned by her father for wearing jeans, the hero getting beaten up by goons for saving the heroine, the heroine dying in the hero's arms on Valentine's Day, etc. The film may seem too filmy or corny for some viewers who prefer subtle or realistic cinema.
3. **Length**: The film is too long and stretched for its own good. The film runs for 2 hours and 34 minutes, which may seem tedious and boring for some viewers. The film could have been edited better to avoid unnecessary scenes or songs that drag the pace of the film. The film also has a slow start and a repetitive climax that may test your patience.

Sanam Teri Kasam is a movie that may appeal to you if you are a fan of romantic dramas or if you are looking for a movie that will make you cry. However, if you are looking for a movie that will offer you something fresh or innovative, you may want to skip this one.
